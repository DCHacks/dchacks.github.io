# DCHacks
DCHacks is Washington, D.C.'s premier high school hackathon and the largest of its kind on the eastern seaboard! We're excited for this year's event; last year's was a huge success! We're inviting more than 400 of the brightest students in the area to come together to create awesome software and hardware projects within 24 hours. We'll then judge the projects at the end of the event for prizes!
